Questions
1. Why is the `fs` core module important for Node development?

The `fs` core module is important for Node development because it provides a way to access the file system. `fs` methods have both synchronous and asynchronous forms.

2. What is the difference between sync and non-sync methods in the `fs` module?

Sync methods are blocking type methods. When you use sync methods code runs sequentially. Each line of code must completely execute before moving to the next. Non-sync methods are non-blocking type methods. Each line of code does not have to wait for the previous one to be finished before it begins executing.

3. Why are modules used?

Modules allow us to reuse blocks of code to perform certain functionalities. When you are making an application you can just import pre-existing modules instead of having to write every piece of code yourself.

4. Why are libraries such as fs used in Node programming?

In Node programming, libraries/modules allow you to add different functionalities to your program. For example, `fs` allows you to manipulate the file system so that you can easily do things like create and read files.
